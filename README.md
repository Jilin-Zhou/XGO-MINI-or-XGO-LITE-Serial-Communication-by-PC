# XGO-MINI-or-XGO-LITE-Serial-Communication-by-PC
由于老款式的机器人没有官方的维护，并且网络上缺少相关的教程。这个库所针对的机器人为宇树科技在20年左右推出的XGO-MINI，其机身为陆吾智能制造，头部开发板为cocorobo系列（仅一个microusb接口，CP210X系列芯片），该库提供了一个直接和机器狗进行串行通信的方式，便于实现PC机协同操作。

Since the old style of robot has no official maintenance, and there is a lack of relevant tutorials on the Internet. The robot targeted by this library is the XGO-MINI launched by Unitree Technology around 20 years, its body is Luwu intelligent manufacturing, and the head development board is the cocoribo series (only one microUSB interface, CP210X series chip), which provides a way to directly communicate with the robot dog in series, which is convenient for PC collaborative operation.
